# Frontier Defense

This project is a GUI-based clone of Plants vs. Zombies. 

Enemy soldiers (Zombies) spawn, move across the screen, and are killed by Soldiers (Plants) which 
the user buys and places into a grid. Plants may generate currency (coins), 
block zombies, or shoot bullets at them. The user may click plants to buy, 
view the quantity of coins (sun), and select a level of difficulty.
  
This game was created in OCaml for a Final Project for CS 3110 - Functional Programming
