  "Coming into this project, I was pretty overwhelmed at the idea of having to \
   create a large scale project from scratch. After scrapping multiple ideas, \
   from a RDBMS to a Dungeon Crawler game, we finally ended up settling on \
   implementing a clone of the classic game Plants vs. Zombies. It was a lot \
   of fun learning how to work with a GUI and once we finally understood what \
   we were doing, I found myself wanting to add more and more features to our \
   game. I was mostly in charge of the lawnmower (horse) logic and drawing the \
   characters used in our game, and adding support for those PNG files in our \
   game using camlimages. Finding support for integrating different packages \
   from Graphics to Camlimages was such a pain because nothing in OCaml is \
   well documented. Nevertheless, this was a great learning experience and I'm \
   proud of how far my group has come. 12/14/2022."
