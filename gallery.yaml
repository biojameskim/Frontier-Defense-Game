  Our project is a GUI-based clone of Plants vs. Zombies. 
  Enemy soldiers (Zombies) spawn, move across the screen, 
  and are killed by Soldiers (Plants) which the user buys 
  and places into a grid. Plants may generate currency (coins),
  block zombies, or shoot bullets at them. The user may click 
  plants to buy, view the quantity of coins (sun), and select 
  a level of difficulty.
